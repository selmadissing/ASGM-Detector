  <h1 align="center">Thesis Project Logbook</h1>
</p>

Here, I keep track of my weekly progress, outlining what I’ve worked on, what’s coming next, and any thoughts along the way.  
The goal is to stay organized, reflect regularly, and make it easier to share updates with my supervisor.

## Week of 7 April – 11 April 2025

### Main Activities and Accomplishments
- Write on the Methodology section with focus on data and study region, EDA and creating patches for OSM
- Decided which OSM features to use
- Understand the pipeline from the baseline mining detector better

### Plans for Next Week
- How to overlay the patches
- Methodology pipeline diagram
- Finish Methodology for milestone deadline

### Challenges, Questions, or Notes
- Challenge: how to do the overlay, should I keep different colours for each OSM feature? I think so. Try out both.
- Question: What to do about the class imbalance? How is it dealt with?
- Question: Are more plots necessary for EDA? The reflectance bands pixel range?
- Question: Where do I show the locations of the sampling points? Where do I discuss it? Maybe EDA?
